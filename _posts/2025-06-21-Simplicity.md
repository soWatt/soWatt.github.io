# [](#header-1) Simplicity
<br/>
My original intentions behind creating this blog was to have write-ups for CTF's, programming, and other notes. When I first started making them, I was so excited to learn about technology and security just for the sake of doing so. Peering under the hood of technology (or any complex systems) will contiue to be so fascinating. Over the past two years I stepped away from my studies to re-evalute my relationship with technology. I've simplified and become more intentional with my technology in order to see it as the incredibly powerful tool it is and not something that saps away the time I have on earth. This has allowed me to experience so many new things while not feeling so drained from spending hours and hours on my computer.

I'm writing this on my phone with an ssh client connected to my only mini pc I own now. Once it pushes to Github Pages, I'll go outside and pitch a hammock in the woods with my friends and actually be fully present. I still want to build things but instead of advancing my career or collecting a larger paycheck (which I feel was the misguided motivation for me getting into my field) I just want it to help those I care about. I'm unsure what will become of this Pages site but I do feel like I finally have clarity as to what role technology is going to play in my life moving forward.

Have a great day and live strong!
