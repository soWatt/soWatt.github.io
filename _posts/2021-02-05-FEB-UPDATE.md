# [](#header-1) February update

Since finishing Advent of cyber 2, I somehow got my usual machine in a perpetual state of blue screens all the way down. I dug my old macbook out of a bag that I used when doing web/mobile development and started cleaning it up. Whenever trying to run virutal-box VM's errors out so I guess I just won't use VM's ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I got all the necessary tools I usually use in Kali with the exception of metasploit so I will probably have to use manual exploits instead.

The topics I will be focusing on for this month will be:
<br/>
- Reverse Engineering
<br/>
- Binary Sec
</br>
- Introductory Crypto
<br/>
<br/>
I'll update this post when each topic is complete. Happy hacking!
