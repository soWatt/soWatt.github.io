# [](#header-1) Switching focus
<br/>
Almost a year has gone by and I haven't written anything on this repository. Through studying security I learned that I really like it as a hobby but not as a career. Through hours of self reflection I realized that what I am interested is the availibility portion of the CIA triangle. The research I have done into DevOps and SRE subjects really align with both my skills and interest. The roadmap that I found on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/devops) will be my roadmap for the future of what I put on this GH pages (with the occasional CTF because they are fun :) ). Honesty with yourself is a virtue, life is too short to follow paths that will make you unhappy.
