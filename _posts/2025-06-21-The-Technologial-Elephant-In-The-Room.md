# [](#header-1) A Great Leap 
<br/>
The last time that I made a complete post on this I still walked through Stack Overflow for answers to my work and side projects. ChatGPT was first released to the public in late 2022 but I didn't use it until way later. At first when my coworkers and friends first told me about it, I thought it was going to be something like a slightly better version of Wolfram Alpha. Admittedly I was impressed when I first used it but not sold on the idea that it was the future.

Fast forward to present day and I think this technology (although still so close to its genesis) is going to fundamentally change how we interact with technology. I'm more interested in creating expert systems that focus on singular (but very complex) problems using this technology. I really want to understand in greater detail how machine learning can be applied to make peoples lives better. Here is where I hope to share my studies, projects, and problems that I set out to solve.
