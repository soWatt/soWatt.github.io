# About me

Hello and welcome to my little slice of the internet! My name is Kyle and I am in the early stages of my career in Information Technology. I currently work as a system engineer primarly focusing on Linux solutions. Information security and programming has always been two areas of great interest for me which led me to create this website! Here you can find my notes, write-ups, research and projects related to the aforementioned topics. Thanks for stopping by and happy hacking!
