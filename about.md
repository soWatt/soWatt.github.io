# About me

Hello and welcome to my little slice of the internet! My name is Kyle and I am in the early stages of my career in Information Technology. I currently work as a system engineer primarly focusing on Linux solutions. Information security has always been an area of great interest for me which led me to create this website! Here you can find my notes, write-ups, research and projects related to cybersecurity. If you would like to contact me please send me a message on the socials I do have which are linked at the bottom of this page. Thanks for stopping by and happy hacking!
